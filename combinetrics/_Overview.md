## Overview of Each
Let's look at a study of numbers called combinetrics.  This involves taking in some sort of set or array and a variations of combinations.  
1. Subsets
- gets all the possible sets of numbers
- order does not matter
- size is empty -> current set
- ex: n: [1, 2, 3]
    - returns: [[], [1], [2], [1 2], [2 3], [1, 2, 3]]

2. Cominations
- all possible combinations of numbers
- order does not matter
- size is length of the original array
- ex: give all size 3 combinations of the array [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - returns [[1, 2], [1, 3], 

3. Permutations
- all possible permutations of a number
- order is important
- size is length of original array
